## Uncle Bill's

During my tenure at Uncle Bill's, I undertook a series of significant projects aimed at improving the company's online presence and user experience. Some key highlights of my work include:

- **Website Restyling**: Completely redesigned and rebuilt both of Uncle Bill's websites from the ground up. This included overhauling a WordPress blog website and an eCommerce website powered by Inet/Epicor. The revamp encompassed content updates and feature enhancements, resulting in a significant increase in website traffic.

- **Dropdown Menu Creation**: Successfully created and styled a dropdown menu for a substantial list of product categories. This enhancement contributed to improved navigation and a more user-friendly experience for website visitors.

- **User Experience Optimization**: Dedicated efforts to optimize the user experience across both websites. This involved improving website layout, responsiveness, and overall usability.

### Skills Utilized

During these projects, I leveraged a wide range of skills and technologies, including:

- Bootstrap
- Algorithms
- User Experience (UX) enhancement
- Software Development
- jQuery
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- JavaScript
- HTML
- SASS

My work at Uncle Bill's was focused on delivering effective solutions that not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal of the websites but also improved their functionality and usability, resulting in a more engaging and satisfying experience for visitors.
