**MWeather** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to provide users with the ability to access weather information by country. This versatile application, MWeather, presents essential weather data, including temperature (both minimum and maximum), wind details (speed and direction), humidity levels, and atmospheric pressure.

The app efficiently retrieves this data through the utilization of the [OpenWeatherMap REST API](https://openweathermap.org/api), a reliable source for weather information. Additionally, the list of countries is sourced from the [REST API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all).

**Tools Used:**

- TypeScript
- React
- Sass
- React-Context
- Axios
- Git
- GitHub
- react-select
